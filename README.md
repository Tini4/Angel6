# Angel6
Discord bot for my friends server.
**the bot still has issues, its hardcoded for one specific server, ytdl playback is flaky with bad internet, code is a mess.**

# TO-DOs:
-Implement slash commands (wont happen any time soon, bot would need to be completely rewritten).

-Add ytdl playlist support (might happen but its not a heavily requested/used feature).

-Support py-cord > 2.0.0b4 (currently py-cord 2.0.0b4 is supported but anything newer wont work).

-Make it more universal (currently the bot has hardcoded channel IDs, server name, shouldnt be to hard to implement but since no one else uses it im not gonna fix it *yet*).

-Fix ~invites command, it shows invites correctly only if used by the message author, if specifying a message.mention it just returns null
